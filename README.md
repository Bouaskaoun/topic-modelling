# Topic Modelling of News Articles using LSA and LDA

Topic modeling is a technique for uncovering the hidden themes or topics within a collection of documents. It involves identifying the words and phrases that are most prevalent in a set of documents and grouping them into topics.

In this project, we will be applying two popular techniques for topic modeling: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Both techniques are useful for identifying the main themes within a large corpus of documents, such as a collection of news articles.

## Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

LSA is a technique for analyzing the relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms. It is based on the idea that words that are used in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.

To implement LSA, we will first preprocess the documents by removing stop words and performing stemming or lemmatization. We will then create a term-document matrix, where each row represents a unique word and each column represents a document. The matrix will contain the frequency of each word in each document.

Next, we will apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to the term-document matrix to obtain a set of latent concepts. These concepts can then be used to identify the main themes within the documents.

## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

LDA is a probabilistic model that assumes that each document is a mixture of a fixed number of topics and that each word in the document is associated with one of the topics. The goal of LDA is to uncover the underlying topics and the probability of each word belonging to each topic.

To implement LDA, we will first preprocess the documents in the same way as we did for LSA. We will then use the preprocessed documents to train the LDA model. Once the model is trained, we can use it to identify the main topics in the documents and the words that are most associated with each topic.

## Conclusion

Both LSA and LDA are useful techniques for uncovering the main themes within a large corpus of documents. LSA is based on the idea that words with similar meanings tend to be used in similar contexts, while LDA is a probabilistic model that assumes that each document is a mixture of a fixed number of topics. By applying these techniques to a collection of news articles, we can identify the main topics and themes discussed in the articles.
